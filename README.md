# Nmap scans

## get_hosts.py
Populates a folder (defined in the get_hosts.py itself, because I am that lazy) with the scan of all the allowed subnetworks in a class C network.
Scans the range 192.168.0-255.0-255

## parse.py
Reads all the files generated by get_hosts.py, extracts the IPs for the up hosts and performs a deep scan (agressive, requires root):\
nmap -sT -O -oN file.out target_host

## extract.py
Reads all the reports (for each host) in a given folder and builds a list of a certain class containing all the info for each host. In the near future it will save this info as a csv or json file.

## TODO
In the future apply subnetmask to find out the real available networks
